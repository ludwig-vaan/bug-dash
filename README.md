Your goal is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies (bugs).

You can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene.

Once you collides with an enemy, the game is reset and you moves back to the start square.

Once you reaches the water the game is won.
